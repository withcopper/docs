## Copper Privacy Policy

> _Last Modified Febrary 9, 2016_

Our mission is to empower people with their personal information and make it universally useful to them. Copper is a tool that organizes your personal information in one account that you own so that you can use online services without the need for a sign up form or password. We collect some information in order for you to have a Copper account and other information that is necessary to make the service work. We view the information you share with us as yours, but under our care, and are committed to respecting your privacy.  

Please take some time to read this Privacy Policy. It applies to your interactions with the Copper application and our website at https://withcopper.com (“**Copper**” or our “**Services**”). It explains what information we collect, how we use it, when we share it, how we protect it, and the choices you have. This policy is part of our [Terms of Service](https://github.com/withcopper/docs/blob/master/Copper-Terms-of-Service.md), and by using our Services you agree to both. We are available at [humans@withcopper.com](mailto:humans@withcopper.com) if you have any questions.

## Information We Collect

> You may choose to provide us with personal information, and give us access to information, to use Copper.

You may also give us permission to access information from other online services you use. Over time we intend to add more types of information based on feedback from users like you and the developers that use Copper. When you use Copper to create an account with the services that work with Copper (our “**Application Providers**”), we will ask your permission to share select pieces of your information with them so that you can create a new account or sign in to an existing account with each service.
